You can also track feature requests from the community in the [separate repo](https://github.com/ever-co/feature-requests/issues).

### Disclaimer

_A word of caution_: We are in α (alpha), i.e. Ever® Platform™ is very much under development (work in progress, WIP).  
Expect _lots_ of changes and some :bug: and please be nice! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Technology Stack and Requirements

-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) language (version >=2.9)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >=10)
-   [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) (version 4) for Shopping Mobile App, Carrier Mobile App and Merchant Tablet App
-   Shopping Website developed with [Angular](https://angular.io) 7 using [Angular Starter](https://github.com/gdi2290/angular-starter)
-   Admin Website developed with [Angular](https://angular.io) version 7 using [ngx-admin](https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin)
-   Headless Commerce framework (Backend APIs/Server) developed using [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) with heavy use of our own Pyro module. Supports GraphQL, REST and WS Real-Time APIs (WebSockets using [Socket.io](https://socket.io) library)
-   [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs) library used heavy in every part of the Platform
-   [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io) used for Inversion Control / Dependency Injection in most parts of the Platform. On the Backend/API we also use DI provided by [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) Database used with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) ORM (supported MongoDB version >= 3.2; we recommend version >=4)
-   We have ongoing effort (WIP) to add support for other databases using [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) and [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma). Following additional DBs will be fully supported: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MS SQL Server and Oracle.
-   For production, we integrate and recommend to use [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)

#### See also README.md and CREDITS.md files in relevant folders for lists of libraries and software included in the Platform, information about licenses and other details.

## Documentation

Please refer to our official [Platform Documentation](https://docs.ever.co) and to our [Wiki](https://github.com/ever-co/ever/wiki) (WIP).

For a quick overview of each project in the Platform (Server, Admin, Shops, etc.), you can search for README.md file in the root of the projects folders. For example, see [./backend/api/README.md](backend/api/README.md) for Server (Backend) related overview.

## Getting Started

We follow [Gitflow Workflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model), so the [`develop` branch](https://github.com/ever-co/ever/tree/develop) may be in an unstable or even broken state during development. Please use [releases](https://github.com/ever-co/ever/releases) or [`master` branch](https://github.com/ever-co/ever/tree/master) instead of the `develop` branch in order to get more stable code.

### Clone Repo

Clone the Ever Platform Git repo:

```
git clone -c core.symlinks=true --recursive https://github.com/ever-co/ever.git
```

Notes:

-   if you want to use development branch (unstable, but latest development) clone using `--branch develop`
-   it's necessary to enable Git symlinks because they used for shared modules (every project has symlinks to shared modules in the /shared folder)
-   because of symlinks, you may need to clone from an elevated command prompt (on Windows)

If you use Git >= v2.14, it probably makes sense to setup following globally:

```
git config --global core.symlinks true
git config --global submodule.recurse true
```

Notes:

-   to setup Symlinks & Submodules recurse locally only (for Ever repo), remove `--global` in the commands above
-   for older Git versions see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4611512/is-there-a-way-to-make-git-pull-automatically-update-submodules/4611550#4611550)
-   at the moment we are not using Git sub-modules, but it may change in the future (we were using them, but decided to drop for now in favor of symlinks)

### Yarn

Currently, we are using `Yarn` (instead of `npm`), so make sure you have latest Yarn version installed before running Ever Platform:

```
npm install -g yarn@latest
```

### Quick installation

After git repo cloned, just run following command to install/bootstrap all dependencies:

```
yarn bootstrap
```

Above command install required packages in all Platform projects using Lerna.

Note: if above command fails for any reason, you can try to install required packages manually by running `yarn` inside every sub-folder with 'package.json' file

### Lerna (manual installation)

We are using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for mono-repo management.
You need to run the following command from the working folder where you cloned Ever git repo, which install Lerna together with other packages:

```
yarn
```

You may instead install Lerna globally:

```
npm install lerna@latest -g
```

Now, after Lerna installed (locally or globally), you need to Bootstrap all dependencies manually:

```
yarn lerna bootstrap
```

The command above install all required packages for every sub-project of the Ever Platform.

### MongoDB

Ever platform configured to use MongoDB by default and assume you have MongoDB service running and accepting connections on the default `localhost:27017`. Please see relevant section in our [documentation](https://github.com/ever-co/ever/wiki/MongoDB).

### Platform Configuration

See relevant section in our [documentation](https://github.com/ever-co/ever/wiki/Ever-Platform-Configuration).

### Run Platform Projects

Finally, each project from Ever Platform could start by single command from this list:

* Run API server `yarn run:server`
* Run Admin Website `yarn run:admin` and open http://localhost:4200
* Run Shopping Mobile App `yarn run:shopmobile` and open http://localhost:4201
* Run Merchant Ionic Tablet App `yarn run:merchant` and open http://localhost:4202
* Run Carrier Mobile app `yarn run:carrier` and open http://localhost:4203
* Run Shopping Website `yarn run:shopweb` and open http://localhost:3000

Note 1: during development you can run server with `yarn run:server:dev` to enable watch on TS files changes

Note 2: on the first run, API Server (Backend) creates MongoDB local database `ever_development` with the following (default) Admin user

-   email: `admin@ever.co`
-   password: `admin`

You can use credentials above to login into Platform Admin App.

## Metrics

According to [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) project, Ever Platform today has more than 120K lines of TypeScript, GraphQL, HTML / CSS and other code files. You can get more details in the relevant section of our [documentation](https://github.com/ever-co/ever/wiki/Metrics).
